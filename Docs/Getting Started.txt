Hi and welcome to Cone, 
a more ergonomic (unit) testing framework and runner for .Net.

Cone aims to make testing fun and effective by providing strong support for test
suite organization and focusing on keeping your tests and domain sharing concepts and code.

The easy way to get started is to look at the "Cone.Samples" project. 

Once built you can find the stand alone console runner in the Bin directory as "Console.exe"
simply run it without arguments to get help. 

Happy testing,
